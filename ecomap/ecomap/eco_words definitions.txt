Environment: The surroundings in which living organisms exist, including the air, water, land, 
and their interrelations, often referred to as the natural world.

Sustainability: The ability to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability 
of future generations to meet their own needs. It involves responsibly managing resources 
and ecosystems to ensure their long-term viability.

Recycle: The process of converting waste materials into new products or raw materials, 
typically to prevent the depletion of resources and reduce the environmental impact of waste disposal.

Sustainable: Capable of being maintained or continued over the long term without causing significant environmental, 
economic, or social harm. It implies practices that balance the needs of the present with the needs of future generations.

Reuse: The practice of using items or materials again, either for their original purpose or for a different purpose, 
in order to minimize waste and resource consumption.

Conservation: The careful management and protection of natural resources, habitats, and ecosystems to prevent their depletion, 
degradation, or destruction.

Reduce: To decrease the amount of waste generated or resources consumed by minimizing unnecessary consumption and adopting 
more efficient practices.

Renewable: Resources that are naturally replenished over time, such as sunlight, wind, water, and biomass, and can be used 
indefinitely without depleting finite reserves.

Carbon: A chemical element that is essential to life and exists in various forms, including carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon compounds. 
It plays a significant role in the Earth's carbon cycle and climate system.

Carbon Footprint: The total amount of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, emitted directly or indirectly by human activities, 
typically expressed in equivalent tons of CO2.

Energy: The capacity to do work, typically derived from various sources such as fossil fuels, renewable resources, or nuclear reactions,
and used to power machines, provide heat, or generate electricity.

Green: Related to practices, products, or lifestyles that are environmentally friendly, sustainable, or promote conservation 
and reduce negative impacts on the environment.

Biodegradable: Capable of being decomposed by biological processes, typically bacteria or other microorganisms, into harmless substances
such as water, carbon dioxide, and organic matter.

Recycling: The process of collecting, sorting, processing, and converting waste materials into new products or raw materials 
to be used again, thus conserving resources and reducing environmental pollution.
